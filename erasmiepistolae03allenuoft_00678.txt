APPENDIX XII
ΤΗΕ EPISTOLAE SELECTAE PER BARLANDVM, 1520

IN December 1520 Martens published at Louvain a volume entitled
Fqlz'stolde aliquot selectae ar Erasmirie per Hadrianum Rarlmzdum. In
the preface Barlaml statos that Martens had requested him to select
some os the shoder letters ‘ ex magno epistolarum Erasmi volumine ’.
for publieation as a schoolbook. The ‘magnum volumen “ is, of
coursey the Farraqo (E), which had appe-„ared in October 1519. Of
the 123 letters which the selection contains, 11 ,ς are derived from
E, 5 are not in E but appear in the mistolae ml diuersos OE), Aug.
1521, and z are not found elsewhere than in this volume of selec-
tione, We are indebted, as so often before, to the kindness of the late
M. Vander Haeghen of Ghent ; who by lending us a copy of Barland‘s
volume has rendered possible a minute examination of its contente.
And a eareful <zonarion by my wife of the variants between E and F
has indicated clearly the position occupied by this book relatively to
those two editions.

The date of the preparation of F has been involved in some
obseurity‚ and it has been possible to infer that the printing of the
book was far advaneed at 3 time when in fact Erasmus had not yet
begun the necessary work ef revision. This obscurity has arisen
frum a wrong year-date, 1520, added in the Opus Epistularum (H).
1529y to Eraernus’ prefaoe tu F, addressed to Beatus Rhenanus from
Louvain, 27 May. In this prefaeev Lond. i. 1. LB. 507, Erasmus
says that he had revised the letters already publisheael, and sent them
to be printed by Froben; who at the time of writing ⁴ iam . . ad xli.
senionem peruenit ’. E and its predecessors, Cly B. D¹, as reprinted
in F, reach p. 47z,¹ including a few new letters, amongst them
Epp. 361y 3132, 540, 605, inserted out of place in order to be next
the letters they answer3 and the fortieth sheet ende on p. 478.ι
Χῗθ may take it, therefore, that Froben’s words, which Erasmus
repeats, meant that he had completed the reprinting of E and its
predecessore, and was ready to begin on the forty-first sheet.

Now ou p. 478 of F 3 letter is printed (Lond. xii. 11, LB. 535)
which bears date 4 Oct. 1520 ς and on p. 534 another (Lond. xiv. 3.
LB. 591) with the date 24 Aug. 1521. Counting the time occupied
in the transit of Froben’s letter to Louvain, and of copies of Erasmus’
letters to Basle-—perhaps a fortnight each way—we may reekon that
if Erasmus’ prefaee to F is really to be dated in 1520, Froben must
have waited about five months, May *Oct 1520, before advancing
six peges, 472-8 ; and nearly sixteen months, May 1520 —Sept 152 1,
before pn'nting 62 peges: a rahe of progress which is not ouly
