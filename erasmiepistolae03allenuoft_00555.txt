Donvr veliementer· sc saepe, Erasme doctissime, binas meas ad te
literas proximo scriptas biennio periisse: periisse enim puto quibus
nihil responderis. Id autem Francisei Calui, qui eas Basileam vsque

vuius congressu spectasse. Interea ineptum putabam aliis te literis
obtundere, studiis praesertim grauior-ibus occupatum : nimirum resti-
tuendae rei theologicae annos iam aliquot deditum, Paulinisque
epistolis illustrandis toto, vt dieitur, pectore vigiliisque ac sudoribus

lo maximis incumbentem. Nam Noui, vt vocant, Instrumenti aeditionem
alteram abs te paratam esse nihil dubito, affirmante id praesertim
