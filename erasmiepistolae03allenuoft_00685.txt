634 APPENDIX XIII

Intleed miswritings in the letters are not uncommon, many of them
being very rapidly ivrittenz so that it is not surprising to find the
printed version sometimes at fault. .

In the two cases (ff. 184, :¹170 where we have the opportunity of
comparing the rough drafts with the fair copies actually sent, it is
notieeable that tho secretary was not scrupulously accurate in his
copying, as we have seen already with Ep. 326 ς writiug for instance
cum for tum, quum for cum, besides -ae for -e and making occasional
differenees of punctuation and order.

The manuscript volume presents us with ample material for an
examinatior] of Erasmus-⁹ oiihography. It appears that he uses the
form -e far more commonly than -ae; which ran-ely occurs except
as -9, In a few cases (ff. 213, 214, 2¹9 νῦ.) in revising Erasmus adds
a cedilla to an -e; but this is quite exoeptioual. The form aedicio,
which with its kindred words is regularly printed hy the Froben
prese, has· hardly any authority in this manuscript, editio being
Erasmus* almost invariable usage; though aocl- occurs thrice, on
ff. 160⁴, and an improving hand, not Eraemus’, has added a ced-illa
once, on fi 209. Again litterae—one of the words about which it is
difficult to collect evidence, because in manuscript it ie so frequently
eontraeted—is almost always found instead of literae. Prg occurs
only rarely, ae als-o pre, the eontracted form being usually adopted,
Sometimes it ie quite impossible to determine certainly what
Erasmus wrote. The vowele are often so alike that the only guido
is in the sense, and where this fails there is no arbiter. The same
word. for example, might not infrequently be read either possum,
possim or possmu nolim or 1mlui; and the terminations -ie and -ius
ore often indistinguishable.
