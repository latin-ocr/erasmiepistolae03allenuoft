THE COPENHAGEN MANUSCRIPT 631

¹5¹9 (Ep. 932. 1668), and by Jnn. 1523116 had made some 1101911 which
he hoped to work up before the close of the year (1. p. 34. 1942 and
crit. n.). After the publication of Cat, Luc. (1) the fulfilmenf of the
promise was often claimed. But from the tribute paid to the memor)-
of Warham (1· 22 Aug. ¹532) it ia clear that this draft at any rate—
aud there is no evidence to show that there was* any otherfoannot
have been hegun before 1532ss ; for the pas—§age occurs [f. 35) in
eontinuous composition and cannot be considered as an insertion.
It was not tin the spring of 1535 that Erasmus began to print ς but
ae there are five booksy and as he suffered much from 1111165»,Ὶ during
his cloeing years. Book 1, with which we are now eoncerned may
wel-l have been begun at the 111116 suggested. This conclusion is
borne out by the 1131161- used. In the Ecclesiastvs 111919 is only one
watermark, and it occurs 30 times. The same occurs on 30 ont of
38 5116616111 1116Αάίιφὶα; 011 2 out of 8 sheets 111 the De przicpn1>atio›1r:
and in all 1116 leuem written in 1533.

The Dc praeparatione ml moriem was written in response to a letter
(EEZ. 109) from Thomas Boleyn, Earl of Wiltehirey dated 19 ιΪ11111Δ
(1533). The prefaee, which in the manuscript has no date, in the
printed book (L) i»- dated 1 Dec. 1533-

The additions 10 the enlarged edition of the Αάιιμῐα, Basle, Froben.
aud Episeopius, March 1533, number 3659-⁴¹46; aud of these 1116
manuscript contains rather more than half. The preface which pre-
cedes 111610 on p. 989 of the printed volume, is dated 1 Oct. 1532 z
and in Q, 7, dated ¹5 Jan. <1533 , Erasmus discusses 1116 1016111611
tion to be put on a phrase which was afterwards included as No. 4082.
They were probably, therefore, compoeed for the most part in 153263.
Νο. 1493 in the manu-script is- a new version of the adage, which
appears for the first time in 1119 edition of 1536,

The notes 011 Seneca were made for the Froben edition of March
1529; those on Augustine Ι have not been able to traee. The·
Froben firm published Augustine's works 111 152869 and ¹54⁰-ss
with the aid of Erasmus; but I cannot find these notes in either
edition.

Thus far there is very little difference of date between 1119 com-
ponent parts of the manuscript. But with the letters there is less
uniformity, one quarter of thern being prior to 1529, 1116 earliest date
yet reached in the other contente of the volume. They are distri-

buted thus :—

1517 1. ¹5²4 3, 1528 4. 1531 11. 1534 1,
1519 1. 1525 1. 1529 2. 1532 2. ¹535 1.
1520 1. 1527 2. 1530 11. 1533 6. 1536 4.

and one uncertain, probably 1533.
The arrangement of the volume as it is now bound! shows little

evidence of design. The letters are, indeedy placed together at the
end: but lhe other compositione are in a confusion from which
a very slight expenditure of trouble would have extricated them;
and it may therefore be safely assumed that the manuscript collection
-in whatever manner it was formed—was sent to the binder in the
condition 111 which it happened 1ο be. We may argue, therefore, that
the collection was not made by any one interested in the papers for
