amicitiam. Ceterum vbi video doctos vno ore omneis meo subscribere
suffragio ae vehementius etiam diuinum hominis ingenium suspicere,

non quod plus ament sed quod plus cernant, serio plaudo meae sen- -

tentiae, nec verebor posthac quod sentio palam eloqui. Quid tandem
non praestitisset admirabilis ista naturae feneitas, si hoc ingenium
instituisset Italia? si totum Musarum saeris vacaret, si ad iustam
frugem ac velut autumnum suum meminisset? Epigrammata lusit
adolescens admodum ae pleraque puer. Britanniam suam nunquam
egressus est, nisi semel atque iterum, Principis sui nomine legatione
fungens apud Flandros. Preter rem vxoriam, preter curas domest-icas,
preter publici muneris functionem et causarum vndas, tot tantisque
regni negociis distrahitur vt mireris esse ocium vel cogitandi de
libn's.

Proinde misimus ad te Progymnasmata illius et Vtopinm, vt, si
videtur, tuis excusa typis orhi posteritatique commendentur: quando
ea est tuae officina autoritas vt liber vel hoe nomine placeat eruditis,
si cognitum sit e Frobeniania edibusprodisse. Bene vale cum optimo
socero, coniuge suauissima sc mellitissimis liberis. Erasmum filiolum
mihi tecum communem, inter litteras natum. sac optimis litteris
instituendum eures. Louanii. 8. Calend. Septemb. An. nm>- 17.
