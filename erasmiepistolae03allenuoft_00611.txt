Cvm iam admonius manum Paraphrasi in Epistulam Pauli ad
Galatas identidem animo circumspicerem cuj laborem eum dedicarem.
quandoquidem hic mos a priscis vsque saeculis in haec nostra tempora
perduranit, commodum allata est pel· Paschasium Bersellium, tibi

se ferens animum erectum, excelsum ac plane talibus stemmatis
dignum. ingenium ardens ac sublimi illi philosophiae natum, quae

humilium quas abiectum vulgus admiratur. contemptum adducit.

ιο Ea quidem res mihi non perinde mil-a fuit atque grata, praesertim
reputanti patris tui Roberti dobes, viri iu bellicae rei laudibus vel
