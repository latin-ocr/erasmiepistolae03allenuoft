It remains to enumerate a few cuseS‚ clearly sorluitous. in which
Barlaud‘s text differs from E and all the subsequeut editions. In
Ep* 89. Τιτ. for sacrus Barlzmd (θ’, b· νῦ.) reads sununs: iu Ep. 151.

examples of textual depravation arising through aberration, which in
most cases would pass quite unsuspected by a subm—quent editor.

Other trifling divergenees might be revealed hy a collation of the

the various readings,

From these details the story of Barlaud‘s Epistulas scleotm may be
deduced. He began to work with E, as Martens had suggested. But
when two-thinis of the book was already complete, Erasmus allowed
him to make use of the ‘text he had just revised for F, also contribui>
ing a few of the new letters which he had selected for publication.
Basland's book appeared eight monsshs and more before F 3 and as it
had Erasmus* concurrence‚ it is evident that for such new matter as
it contains, it is the archetype.
