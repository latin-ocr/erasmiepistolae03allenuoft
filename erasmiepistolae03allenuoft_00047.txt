[An sutosraph throughout, M. Philippe Renousrd hss kindly allowed me to
avsil myselfoi liis intimate knowledge of Badius* publicatione, snd in rnswer
to my inquii-y ut oni-e indicated that the book here referred io is the Antiquae
Loesium-s us melius Rhodiginus. The first edition n( this was publislied by the
Aldine firm in reb. 151⁶, ond s copy xesrhed Froben through the Franlrmt
teir in Sept. 1516 ilzp. 469- an.. He printed ir in tho winter oi ,με-7
lEp. 5⁵6· 27 , and the colophon is dated ιε Mei-rh ¹⁵17 (not 1513, ns Psnzer).
Mesowhile Badius slso was reprodueing the Aldine edition, 13 „lune 1517,2nd
in his preioee or ths some date, io Remigius Ruffus, he wriees: ‘Tu enini istis
libris quos mihi euppeditasti non carebas, et sciebas duplo minoris a nubis <suam al>
ναι-φης redimmios‘ iet. Ph. Rmouard, Brirlioyrophie αι Josse Badius, iii. 209,xo).
But the priority oi Froh2n⁴s edition is apparent, not reon ior its title-pugo
contains on the rrezo the presaee sugg»sted here by Erasmus, which ean only
hsve bren written after the appearance of Bsdius’ volume.

For this conflirt (if dates three explanation! are poseihla: (1) that Froben's
hook is to he dated in March ιειὲ, (a) thot the British Museuin copy, which
is the only ons 1 hsve exsmiued-ir once belonged to John Teker, Cui-dina!
eollese, exford-is s re-issue with s new titlffpagel (3) that the substantive
pare orthe hook wss eompleted hy the dote given in ths colophon, but that this
heinh- loo late for the Frsnkfort spring isir, ihs introductory sheets (foriy
iolios of inderes,ese„ with separate signati-res] were finished more 1eisure1y;
snd that thus there was time for Era-imus* prefate to be included. No. ι seems
io me improbable. The German year usually began se Christmus or r san„
and Ι know of no other instance in which Froben uses the ‘old ntyle¹; though
Erasmus sometimes adopts it in his letters tu friends who were meuswmed to
it (cf, Ep. 522 introde). or the practice suggested in No. 2 Dr. Beruoulli hes
shown me sn example in two copies oi the saw-e of ¹⁵1⁵(El'‹ es9inirod,)in
the Bssle University Lihmry, where the title-peges differ eonsiderably, hue
otherwise there is no apparent vsriation. But though tisis was doulruess done
in orher esses slso, there is no suggestion in this letter of substituting u new
pressee ior one slresdy used; sud 1 therefore prefer the third explanation

As to the date, there is no oleat indication aa (o Erasmus* eoi-respondeum
with Bssle in the summer of 1517, exuent that hs sent one pocket. in May
(Ep. 534Δ r5h, which wss snswered from Basle, ol ι5 July (Emi. 593. 9>; sod
