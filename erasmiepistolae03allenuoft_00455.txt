406 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1518

being withheld from puhlieation at Lnng’s tvieh (σε. al). 1t is not clear why
Ep. 875, whirh was afterwards printed hy Erasmus in E, does not appear
in thanus· ooolr: possibly Werter had passed ont of his reach, hearing llio
letter with him, It may also be notioed that Erasmus never rsprinted any
of the lettere which oro in the Hidotpon‘wn.

Eobanus sent o copy oso to Beatus Rhenanus at Basle, drawing his attention
to the hlunders of the printere: now at Schlettstadt, eat. Rhen. 235. Another
copy, evidently with o similar inscription, was sent to lili-namus at Louvain (Ep.

some additione, 0nc of these is visinus¹ poem in prniae of Erasmus «ΕΡ. 851.

amnes, which ia perhaps a versification of ιικ. lna. (ef. l. 9 n.). To it is
prefixed a letter of enlogy froin Gilles, with the dates ai Moy 1519, Antwerp;
and tho latest ofErasnnnsy compositione mentioned is the Pnraphrnse on Galatians

has two independent readings, and in Epp. 8745 twice follows Β instead of
n. Three of these may he intentional corrections, two (which arc inem-rect>
perhaps arising froin untumiliarity with the form mom ; while the remaining
two are mei-e differencea in the spelling or names. This slight divergenee
therefore need not prevent the inference (which is antecedently prohahle) that
Draco had e aa his basis.

The omission emp. 1³7³ in οι pi-ohahly shows that Merula was printing from 7;
and this conolusion is supported hy nis variants, thoae in Epp. n7o-i, 87⁴ heing
explainable as mere degeneratione. For 0² Seriverius on the whole rollowed
Merulo‘s lert, also omitting Ep. ⁸73 hut making eorreetions in Ep. 871. Only in
Ep, 870 οἵ has two definite variants ior which it is not easy to account]
