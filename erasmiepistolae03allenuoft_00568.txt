933] FROM MARTIN LUTHER 517

John Aurlfaher, Jeno, c. Rhodius, 155⁶. For eonvenienso 1 hsve plnoed it in
the asmo position here ss o in Ep. 9in,

martin Lnther (iu Nove 1432 22-18 Feli. 154⁶), efter sohooling st Msnsfeld,
Msgdehnrg snd Eisenseh, hsd hoen st Erfurt University (ΒΛ. 1502, ΜΛ, 1505),
sna then hod withdrawn, 17 Jnly 15⁰5! into tho Atigustlnisn house st Erfnrt.
After receiving priest's orders ir. ¹⁵07 lie emerged in 1508 to tesrh in the new
university founded hy nuhe Frederick ol Snxony et Wittenherg. ln 152& he
mede the visit to nome which eo profonndly impressed him ς nnd having taken
his m). 19 Oet. 1512, he suoceerled Stsupitz (p. 40⁸! ns Professor ol Theology st
Wittenlierg. For s lew yosrs he continued to live the quiet life of s teneher,
snrl wss little known, He hsd pnhlished nothing, end oi the thonssnds ornis
extent letter-s only ro ore snterior to 1516. gut the 95 theses directed
against indulgenoes which ho posted siwittonheie ει Oct. ¹5¹7 [ef⁴ Ep. 7¹35·
37 n.) brought him stonre into confliet with Rome ; end his writings soon hegen
to eironlste in print (ΕΡ. eon ις n).

His first cominnniestion with Erssmus u-ss in 151⁶, when he wrote to ssls,
through Spoletinus, for Erasmus· viows on rr question ofthooiogy (ΕΡ. 501 ; cl.
ΠΨ. affl: lint he qulckly carne to perceive (ΗΡ. :w x March 1517l the tundn-
mentsl difference thet was to divide thorn. uls words thore shout Erasmus,
*hun-sne prsenslent in eo plns quom diuinm* express the position eoneisely,
though iu n sense thst he hnrdly intended: the differenre hetween tho hnmsnist
scholar seeklug to sdvonoe knowledge in relisnce on humen resson, snd tho
religione leodereontemningthe things ofthisworld snol onsning human advenae>
montsnd even truth with aid from realrnsin which reason isnot olwsys allowed
to have its perfect work.

Luther did his nest to mininrize this dlvergence <Lm 59, 125; ct 1⁶3. 55„
when he rnsde the presont advenae to Erasmus, it wse «till only lstent; ond he
hoped that nintusl respect might lie possible, perhaps even mutual help. A dny
esrlior, in dedicoting to Duke Frederich his commentaries on the Psslnis, he
hsd written ι -Ego pro ineo temeritate slesnr ieci, extr-rma semper tentsre et
exspecter-e pur-atus ¹ (Lm roo. er, 2). Thonsh he lrsd stood fast sgsinst najetan
stAngshnrg in Oet. 1518, he wss still tremulons, liis ooursge not yet stshlished
hy the triumph ot Worrns. His friends (rs. Ep. με), even more thsn himself,
were conscions os the dongei-s hefore hirn, ond songht tn rslly round him the
support of rnen of learning.

Erasmus sn his sido lruew Luther on1y hy repnte, though the repnte wss
sood (cf. LEJ. 92). 1-1e hsd not resd Luther¹s hoohs; hut he hod hesrd enough
of thern to dissustle Froben froin printing them <Ep 904. ις, ω, snd ho shrenls
lnstinctively frorn open stt-ise ss tendine to obsonio the issues. His reply,
therefore, was not eordial, ond expressed st ont-e his dislihe ot tho troubles
thst Lntherz« outspokenness wss provoking. Yet it wne not without encourage-
ment; indeed, os he told Lnther, lie hsd slresdy stood ioiwsrd to defend him
(Ep 939. oo serp), snd this dorence he repented to other persone of influente (cf.
Epo 967. 78 εει-4.), though without committing himself to Lnthei's viaws.

As the yesrs went on, he more snd more ioohed on Luther os retsrding the
prosross or s movement for pesosrul reform, which, impelled in no smsll measure
ιγ liis own writings sud inlluonse, hsd seerned well upon its way. 1n the joy
ol hsttle ond of victory Luther ssw Erasmus ss one who hed not hoen for him;
snd s pei-sona} qusrrel followed, emliitterine their relations for even Luther
in liis turn lived to regsrd the sdvsnoed Reforrners as Ernsmushad regarded
him ; ns rnen who were sowing ont of his hands and ruining s movonoent which
ho considered his own.]
