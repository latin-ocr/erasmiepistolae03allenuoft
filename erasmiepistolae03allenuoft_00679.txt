most improbable in itself, but also quite at varianae with his rapidity
in printing the New Testament (Ep. 384 inti-od.)⁴ It may fairly be
eoncluded, therefore, that Erasmus’ preface to Pis 1ο be dated 1521 ;
a conclusion which is supported by the fact that 11 is printed on the
first and final sheety α, 1171111 only two other letters, which are dated
13 Aug. and 14 01311521.

Externa] evidence also is available to corroborate this result. In
July ¹5²0 Erasmus writes to Mosellanus that he is preparing a reviv
sion of the Fam-1190 ;¹ and on 30 Nov. he tells Barland that the work
is done! Further. in a letter of (c. Jan.) 1521, Froben-⁴ announces
10 Boniface Amerbach at Avignon that Erasmus has sent ‘Epistolare
suum X Under these circumstances it is evident that Barland’s
volume is prior 10 F in time.

That Barland's collection was taken 111 the main from E is shown
by the various readings. of the 1¹5 letters which it repr-ints
from Ε, just half (58) have no variants in Ἐς but of the remain-
ing 57, 41 invariably follow Ε where 11 differs from F. Two
letters, Epp. ²79 and 821, appear in both D and E, and are in
consequence twice reprinted in F. In each case Barland’s text
follows EF¹ nine times, as against DF¹ once: the single exceptione
being. in Ep. 279. 13 munim (fl). d2) for nauem, in Ep. 821. 6 iuuat
(f‘l. h') for iuuet, both perhaps merely accidental.

There are, however. two more categories, 4 letters 111 which
Barland‘s text follows sometimes E and sometimes F, and 10
letters in which it follows P against Ε. Iu Ep. 56 (fo. k νῦ.) Bar»
land follows Ε11111.16, 26, and Fin11.14, 23, 35. In Ep. 1 23 (ὓ). k)
Barland follows E in ll. 19. 23, and F i.n ll⁴ 6, 8, 15, 18, 26. In Ep.
165 (θ’. 1 νυ.) E once and F once in l. 1 hy reading a Comama-nm
and F in l. 3. In Ep. 264 (10. k⁴ νὴ) Ε Col-rigi· in l. 25, F inl. 2.

As to the final category, in Ep. 54 (fv. 1ι v0.) Barland has the
readings introduced in F for ll. 10, 15, 19 : in Epp. 62. 4 (ἰο. 1’), 151. 8
(5⁸0. i4) the easy corrections made iu F: in Ep. 148 (f0. r] the readings
ofF for 11. ,1, 5: in Ep. 163 (1³0. i⁴ vlu] the addition to the title: in
Ep. 225 (fl‘. k³ v0.) the correction in l. 20: in Ep. 252 (1⁸⁰. k‘) the
addition in 1. 16 ι in Ep⁴ 254 (θ’, k³ v'h] the addition to the title: in
Ep. 415 (f0. k³) the necessary addition for 1. 7: and in Ep⁴ 918
(fn. 1⁴1² w.) the variation in the opening word.

From the decided character of some of the changes in this last
category it is clear that their agreement with F is not sextu-itone:
and this fact coupled with the inclusion in Barland's volume of six
new letters which were subsequently printed in F. indicates that
Erasmus must hnve sanctioned the undertaking. It may also be
inferred that he did not begin to interest himself 111 the book until
it was nearing conipletion. The new letters are all at the end, Nos.
