989] FROM NICHOLAS BERALDUS 619

Decauum, eunom-em. Is enim iu hac, vt sic dixerim, palaestra ιο
prouocati abs te mauult quam te prouocare: vir alioqui in quouis
scribendi genere non mediocriter antehac versatus, bonarumque
omnium sed diuinarum praesertim liberarum adeo stud-iosusy vt
quem huic praeferamus habeamus profecto nemi-nem. Eius nomine
interim libi salueein adscribo, Rogo ineuper ne hominis integerrimi ¹⁵
simul et humanissimi familiaritatem asperneris, qui eum multis
nominibus tuln hoc praecipue dignus est amicitia tua, quod eam
tantopere tamque, prope dixerim, ambitiose expeeit; quantouis
precio empturus, nisi Erasmus cunetis obuius gratisque expositus
esset, Salutat te Deloinus, Ruzaeus, omnes. Budaeus, eum haee πο
scriberem, ruri cum vxore ac liberis agebat; propediem in vrbem
rediturus, simulatque. vt puto, vxor perssuriens pepererit Budaeique
familiam auxerit. Vale.
