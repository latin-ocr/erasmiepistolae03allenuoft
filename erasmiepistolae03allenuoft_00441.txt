[The course of Erasmus' Journey from Basle to Louvain is easy to follow in
this letior, but the precise dates of each stage are more difficult. He was still
nt Barla on l Sept, when lm roceived Ep. 810 (ef. Epp. 8⁶9. με, sss. ω. 1) ; lint
after tlmt tlie only ἥκω point tlnit lio gives is that ho reached Cologue on n
Suuday. On ¹5 Sept. it was known :it Zurich that he had left anle (ef. Ep.
εει. 5 ιι.) The firot part rvr his journey occupied at lom eight days, according
ιο tiro 50:¹qu monti-mod, so [hat liis arrival at Culngue cannot bo dated 5 Sept,
hut niust fall on ιε Sept. 'nio following itiuerary may he traeorl:

5, 6 Sept. lg.» Strashurg reached oy lione about o nnn: tlio night perhaps rpont
thoro, or porsilily a beginning mado of tire journoy ιο Spires.

6, 7 nupt. On horsetock to Spiror: tire distance, δε milor, required two days
ref. l. 1525y but no plato is mentioned for tlie night.

The first dates til-e questionable because os tire uncertainty of Erasmus' move-

2 or 3 Sept. The date of arrival iu Louvain neem-ds well with Erasmus'estimate
in l. 248 that he had been abnui. four weeks in Mnrtens’ house. But his stata>
