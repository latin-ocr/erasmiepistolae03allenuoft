The correspondenco of Berneggei- printed by Dr. Reifferscheid (Βῆ-ψ ε. linive
yclsheims, M. B-rneqyeri und ihrer Fraude, 1889, 265, αδδ, 293ῑ and pp. 831, 844,

see ADBQ wa* staying with hin-i in his house at Stranburg in the winter of
‚aaa-5„ and thus it is clear that Bernegger waa tlie author of the colophon
quoted, and tlist it was to him that John Pupp (perhaps a aon of tlie John Pupp,
154921610, wlio was nie leader of tlie Lutherana at strasbui-gi lent the mss.

*rho history of tlie Rehd'iger liisv may thus be traced down to the present day.
Clearly Gerbell (†¹55⁰) lind aequired it from Erasmus or hia heirs. Iu March
1⁶29 it uvas in the hands of Gerbell‘s granddaugiiter at Strasburg: by κως one of
tlie Rchdigers liad purchased it and placed it in the ‘rown Library at Breslau,
where it still is; tlie agent in the trans-action being perhaps Roberthiuua, wlio
probably made tlie Rehdigels' anquaintance in 1622 (Reifferscheid, ep. cil. 97. 71).

The relation of Leclere's appendix to Feeht⁴a book remains to he considered.
1n quantity they are identicsl. Each has ⁴3 letters frons tlie Rehdiger ms. (one
os Leclerc's is in the body or the work, 1093) and 2 (LB. App. 325, 375) frons
sanie other source. 1n licui many of ilie letters are abridged, to exantly tlie
same extent. Leclerc'e text, too, apert irone inevitehle depravatione and one
conjectural anip1ificstion oi a heading, appears to agree with feerit-a. ‘nie
πὲρι-ἱεὶς which he adds to these letters merely denotes that they had not been
included in earlier editions of Erasmus· letters, The infererice seems thei-s
tore to be plain that Leclere derived them, not from the originale, but fron-l
ξεῐὴὲῗὴζιοοὶςς aud further that the abridgment ο( the letters was done by
