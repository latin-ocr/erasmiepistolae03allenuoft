‘riris praiaco rnay hs dated with Ep. 6o3. Li. ε, 9 show that Erasmus expected
to find Glareanus still at Basia. Iu eommitting tn him tho decision whether or
nn the Declamatio should ho printed, he acted with design. In nn uuprinted letter-
te Myconius, 15 Oet. r5is (see Fritzsehe, morcon, pp. 2343, Gisreauun snye that
he had written a stclssmalm morti, contemnendae, and that Erasmus had oneo
promised to puhiish it in company with something ns his own. For some reason
Erazmus was now unwilling to fulfll this pr<=mise3 and evidently hoped by
pincing the matter in Glareanus’ hands to he able at lent to cinim that he had
not acted without giving notice tc his friend. Bet Glareanus, being in Paris,
was not forowarned ; and iu consequence was soreiy dissppointod to find, instead
of hia own composition, s deeiamacion hy fai—osricus nn the same oubjoet]
