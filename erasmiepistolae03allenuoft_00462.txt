putant quod illum magno suo malo adierinty aut Christo imputant ¹⁵
quod ingenti periculo suo Hierosolymam viserint: eum vtrumque
verioribus officiis domi licuisset demereri. Iampridem in libris
meliorem Erasmi videras imaginemy si qua tamen bona est, imo
iuxta Platonem totum videras Erasmum. Quid igilur supererat
tantis expetendum itineribus? Verus amor ani-mis constat, quem πο
saepenumero vel dissoluit vel minuit corporum coniunctio. Sed inv
humanus sim si vere succenseam tibi 5 qui ob hoe ipsum dignus es
qui redameris, quot] amas impotentius. Bene vale.
