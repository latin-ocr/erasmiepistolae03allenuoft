PREFACE

As this work proceeds I have an increasing sense of what it
owes to others, Erasmus was a great traveller; and his letters,
too, have wandered into many lamis—not always those to which
they were addressed, It is a continual pleasure to recall not
merely the ready welcome accorded to us iu the numerous
librar-ies and archives it has been necessary to visit, but also
the sympathetic interest which has led these weleoming friends
to remember our studies, aud to report, and even t«) make,
discoveries likely to be of value.

The most important of these has been contri buteul by Professor
Roersch of Ghent3 who found a clue which enabled him to trace
the de Ram collection of Erasmus' letters to Schema and Vander
Noot in the possession of M, Louis Neve of Louvain. Though
engaged himself iu widely different pursuits, M. Neve at once
recognized the importauce of the discovery, and with the utmost
generosity allowed Professor Roersch to place them in our hands
at Gheut in June 1910, to be copied. Since then, with the
instinct of a true scholar, he has made it easy for them to pass
iu two divisions into the British Museum aud the Bodleian,
rather than submit them to be scattered by tha² chauces of thc
market-place.

For other diseoveries, less important, perhaps, but scarcely
less acceptaffle, for the loan of books, for advice given, aud for
reseamhes cheerfull y uudertaken our thauks are due :

in Belgium to MM. Ferdinand Vander Haeghen (†) and
R, Vaudeu Berghe, to Fr. L. Rousseau, to Dr. H. de Vocht,
aud again to Professor Roersch;

in France to MM. Delcourt and de Ricci and Ph. Renouard
aud Weiss, the first of whom has repeatedly helped in
inquiries, unhappily fruitless, after the letters of More
used by Stapleton at Douay;

iu Germany to Dr. Bellesheim and Dr. Miiller of Aacheu,
Professor Hippe of Breslau, Dr. Keussen of Cobgne,
Dr. Ritter of Emden, Dr. Reicke of Nuremberg,
Dr. Claussen of Rosmek;
