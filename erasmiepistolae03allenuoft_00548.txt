QVOD tam amicas iiteras ad me dederis, suauissima Carine, gratiam
habeo5 quod tam eruditas, tibi gratulor. Vix enim mihi pmsuasit
Nesenus tuo Marte, quod aiunt, fuisse conditas: sed persuasit tamen,
vel quia vir minime vanus, vel quia mihi iampridem nota ingenii
tui felicitas. Perge, mi Carine, tibi solidam parare felicitatem. Id 5
facies si veram eruditionem cum morum integritate conjunxeris.
caetera vel non ambienti dabunt coelites.
