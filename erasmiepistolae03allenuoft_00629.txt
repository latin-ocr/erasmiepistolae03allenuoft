578 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [¹5¹9

Antuei-piae xvnx. Calend. Maias scriptis, eum ob alia non paucay

tum quod eruditissimae simul et elegantissimae tuum erga nos,

synceram et veram Christi eruditionem et Euangelicilm veritatem,

studium et amorem pientissimum iam pridem nobis exploratum
lo fecerunt perspectioreni.

Est, vt scribis, mira osorum melioris doctrinae conspiratio, in id
solum idonea, vt bonisy piis et probe literatis noceat. Non damnari
ab eruditis eausam Lutheranam, et Doctoris Martini lucubrationes ab
optimis quibusque istie cupidissime legiy laetamur3 eoque magis

¹5 quod plerique bonorum et eruditorum in nostris quoque regionibus
et principatibus, nedum externis, hominis tam vitam et mores quam
eruditionem miro consensu laudant. Quod enim haetenus in
Saxonibus nostris degit, non tam homini quam causae dedimus,
nihil minus vnquam eonati quam vt dignos premiis poena premeret*

20 Neque Deo omnipotente iuuante committemus vt nostra eulpa inno—
cens quispiam sua querentium impietati dedatur.

Ad haec, Deo autore, bonis literis et rectis studiis, et eorum tam
professoribus quam studiosis, non minus in posterum fauebimus
quam hactenus sauimutl: id quod pro praecipua nostra erga te

25 gratia latere te noluimus irl praesentiarum. Bene vale, doctissime
Erasme.

[The irnpoit oi the si-riea of letters eddreseed te England at this time
(spp. 961⁴, 9⁶44) is quite clear. Witheut making a direct request, Erasmus
intimated that he ποι-ω he glad to return and settle there, ir suitahle provieion
could he made fer himerii-ousion, ef coursey which should ensure him leieure
and not infringe hie independenee.

When he last leit Englssnd he had felt himself secure, without need io look to
English help (Ep. 577i. He had taken service with charles sp. 370. ism), and
his allegiance required that he should eettle in the Netherlands : the revision oi
the New Teetsment was oucupying hie thoughts, and the way seemed open sor
him to complete and print it. But in two years his world had changed. The

Leuvain hed become a less pleasant home than he had expected. eharles hed

have hethought himself te accept (cs. Epp. 2³25. 14-5, ³55· asae) one oi the
numerous invitatious he had received in recent years (Ep. sco. 127-33).

From England in particular these had heen promising (Ep. ⁶94. re), though
